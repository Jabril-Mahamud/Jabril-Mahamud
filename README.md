# 👋 Hi, I'm Jabril

I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for building robust, scalable, and meaningful systems.  
I’ve worked across the full stack — from front-end interfaces to backend services and cloud infrastructure — and I’m always looking for ways to make technology more efficient, reliable, and impactful.  

Currently, I’m working at **BP**, focusing on **Go**, **Kubernetes**, and the **LGTM stack** to strengthen observability and reliability across distributed systems.

### 🧠 What I Bring
- 💻 Experience across **frontend, backend, and cloud** — capable of taking projects end-to-end  
- ⚙️ Skilled in **TypeScript, React, Node.js, Python, and SQL**  
- ☁️ Deep understanding of **AWS, Azure, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines**  
- 🔍 Interested in the intersection of **systems engineering, developer experience, and reliability**

---

### 💡 Currently Working On
- Expanding my skills in **Go** for backend and infrastructure applications  
- Developing a stronger understanding of **Kubernetes internals** and **Helm-based deployments**  
- Building out **observability pipelines** using the **LGTM stack (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, Mimir)**  
- Continuing to explore how full-stack principles apply within cloud-native systems
