# Hi, I'm Jabril 👍
I'm a Software Engineer with 4 years of experience building and maintaining production systems at **BP** 💼.
I've worked across the full stack, from React frontends and RESTful APIs to backend microservices, cloud infrastructure, and more recently, **platform engineering and observability** 🔍.
I'm currently working with **Kubernetes**, **Go**, and the **LGTM observability stack** (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, Mimir), focusing on improving how we monitor, debug, and scale distributed systems 💻.

### What I Do at BP
**Current Focus:**  
I'm now working on **platform engineering and observability**, using:
- **Kubernetes** for container orchestration and cluster management 🚀
- **Go** for building internal tooling and backend services ⚡️
- **LGTM Stack** (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, Mimir) for distributed tracing, logging, and metrics 🔎
- Improving service reliability, debugging workflows, and system observability across microservices 📈

### Technical Background
**Languages:** Go, TypeScript, Python, C#, JavaScript, SQL 💻
**Frontend:** React, Next.js 🚀
**Backend & APIs:** Node.js, Django, ASP.NET, Express ⚡️
**Cloud & Infrastructure:** Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, AWS, Azure 🌐
**Observability:** Grafana, Loki, Tempo, Prometheus, Mimir 🔍
**Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB 💾

### Current Learning Focus
I'm actively deepening my knowledge in:
- **Kubernetes internals**, understanding pods, deployments, services, operators, and cluster management 🤔
- **Go** for building efficient, production-grade backend services and tooling ⚡️
- **Distributed tracing and observability**, using Tempo, Loki, and Grafana to debug and optimize microservices 🔎
- **Platform engineering patterns**, applying full-stack experience to infrastructure and developer experience challenges 💻

### Key Projects
**Energy Market Analytics Platform** (BP) 📊
Built scalable microservices processing large energy market datasets using **Node.js, C#, React, TypeScript**, and **Azure Functions**. Developed real-time dashboards and integrated API Management for notification workflows.
**Real-time Data Processing Pipeline** (BP) 💻
Created a Python-based **AWS EC2 monitoring system** with real-time analytics dashboards using **React and Django**, improving operational visibility and resource tracking.

### What I'm Working Toward
- Building **production-grade Kubernetes expertise** through hands-on work 🚀
- Writing clean, efficient **Go code** for backend services and internal tooling ⚡️
- Contributing to **observability infrastructure** that helps teams understand and improve their systems 🔎
- Bridging the gap between **product engineering and platform engineering** by applying full-stack thinking to infrastructure problems 💻

### Notes
I've spent 4 years at BP working across different layers of the stack. While much of my work is internal and not public, I'm always happy to discuss **cloud-native engineering, observability, microservices architecture**, or anything full-stack related 🤔.

Currently based in **London, UK** 👋.
