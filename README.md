# Hi, I'm Jabril

I'm a Software Engineer with 4 years of experience building and maintaining production systems at **BP**.  
I've worked across the full stack, from React frontends and RESTful APIs to backend microservices, cloud infrastructure, and more recently, **platform engineering and observability**.

I'm currently working with **Kubernetes**, **Go**, and the **LGTM observability stack** (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, Mimir), focusing on improving how we monitor, debug, and scale distributed systems.

### What I Do at BP

**Current Focus:**  
I'm now working on **platform engineering and observability**, using:
- **Kubernetes** for container orchestration and cluster management  
- **Go** for building internal tooling and backend services  
- **LGTM Stack** (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, Mimir) for distributed tracing, logging, and metrics  
- Improving service reliability, debugging workflows, and system observability across microservices  

**Background:**  
I've spent several years at BP building **full-stack applications and backend services**:
- Developed **microservices** in **C#** and **Node.js**, integrated with **React** dashboards for real-time analytics  
- Designed and maintained **RESTful APIs** for high-throughput energy market data services  
- Built **serverless applications** on **Azure**, including Functions, API Management, and automated CI/CD pipelines  
- Worked extensively with **Python** and **Django** for data processing pipelines and internal tooling  
- Deployed and managed cloud infrastructure on **AWS EC2**, improving resource utilization and monitoring  
- Participated in **Agile teams**, including sprint planning, code reviews, stakeholder demos, and retrospectives  

### Technical Background

**Languages:** Go, TypeScript, Python, C#, JavaScript, SQL  
**Frontend:** React, Next.js  
**Backend & APIs:** Node.js, Django, ASP.NET, Express  
**Cloud & Infrastructure:** Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, AWS, Azure  
**Observability:** Grafana, Loki, Tempo, Prometheus, Mimir  
**Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB  
**DevOps:** CI/CD pipelines, Git, infrastructure automation  

### Current Learning Focus

I'm actively deepening my knowledge in:
- **Kubernetes internals**, understanding pods, deployments, services, operators, and cluster management  
- **Go** for building efficient, production-grade backend services and tooling  
- **Distributed tracing and observability**, using Tempo, Loki, and Grafana to debug and optimize microservices  
- **Platform engineering patterns**, applying full-stack experience to infrastructure and developer experience challenges  

### Key Projects

**Energy Market Analytics Platform** (BP)  
Built scalable microservices processing large energy market datasets using **Node.js, C#, React, TypeScript**, and **Azure Functions**. Developed real-time dashboards and integrated API Management for notification workflows.

**Real-time Data Processing Pipeline** (BP)  
Created a Python-based **AWS EC2 monitoring system** with real-time analytics dashboards using **React and Django**, improving operational visibility and resource tracking.

### What I'm Working Toward

- Building **production-grade Kubernetes expertise** through hands-on work  
- Writing clean, efficient **Go code** for backend services and internal tooling  
- Contributing to **observability infrastructure** that helps teams understand and improve their systems  
- Bridging the gap between **product engineering and platform engineering** by applying full-stack thinking to infrastructure problems  

### Notes

I've spent 4 years at BP working across different layers of the stack. While much of my work is internal and not public, I'm always happy to discuss **cloud-native engineering, observability, microservices architecture**, or anything full-stack related.

Currently based in **London, UK**.
